    a long and abnormally hot summer. The first hints of autumn beckon, but a heavy heat persists,
    relentless. A silent, unspoken anger grips the town. Tempers are short, and in the last week
    alone there have been numerous reports of townspeople coming to heated, violent blows with one
    another over simple misunderstandings.\n
        \nAnd now, a call from James Hankerson, he claims to have found a dismembered body in his barn.\n
        \nBlaming the weather would be too easy. There is something wrong with this town, and not a
        whole lot this old soothsayer can do to stop the slide. My auguries indicate a small group
        of investigators will soon take note of these strange happenings and set forth to make
        things right. I\'ll be watching their progress&#8230;but I won\'t be holding my breath.</string>

    <!--Scenario One - The Gathering-->

    <string name="gathering_setup"><b>Scenario 1: The Gathering</b>\n
        \nYou and your partners have been investigating strange events
        taking place in your home city of Arkham, Massachusetts. Over the past few weeks, several
        townspeople have mysetriously gone missing. Recently, their corpses turned up in the woods,
        savaged and half-eaten. The police and newspapers have stated that wild animals are
        responsible, but you believe there is something else going on. You are gathered together at
        the lead investigator\'s home to discuss these bizarre events.</string>

    <string name="gathering_sets">The Gathering, Rats, Ghouls, Striking Fear, Ancient Evils, and Chilling Cold.</string>
    <string name="gathering_locations">Put the Study location into play.\n</string>
    <string name="gathering_set_aside">All other locations, the Ghoul Priest and Lita Chantler.\n</string>

    <string name="gathering_no_resolution">You barely managed to escape your house with your lives.
    The woman from your parlor follows you out the front door, slamming it behind her. \"You fools!
    See what you have done?\" She pushes a chair in front of the door, lodging it beneath the
    doorknob. \"We must get out of here. Come with me, and I will tell you what I know. We are the
    only ones who can stop the threat that lurks beneath from being unleashed throughout the city.\"
    You\'re in no state to argue. Nodding, you follow the woman as she runs from your front porch out
    into the rainy street, toward Rivertown.\n
    \n<b>The lead investigator earns the Lita Chantler card.</b></string>
    <string name="gathering_resolution_one">You nod and allow the red-haired woman to set the walls
    and floor of your house ablaze. The fire spreads quickly, and you run out the front door to
    avoid being caught in the inferno. From the sidewalk, you watch as everything you own is
    consumed by the flames. \"Come with me,\" the woman says. \"You must be told of the threat that
    lurks below. Alone, we are surely doomed&#8230;but together, we can stop it.\"\n
    \n<b>The lead investigator earns the Lita Chantler card.</b></string>
    <string name="gathering_resolution_two">You refuse to follow the overzealous woman\'s order and
    kick her out of your home for fear that she will set it ablaze without your permission. \"Fools!
    You are making a grave mistake!\" she warns. \"You do not understand the threat that lurks below
    &#8230;the grave danger we are all in!\" Still shaken by the night\'s events, you decide to hear
    the woman out. Perhaps she can shed some light on these bizarre events&#8230;but she doesn\'t
    seem to trust you very much.</string>
    <string name="gathering_resolution_three">You run to the hallway to try to find a way to escape
    the house, but the burning-hot barrier still blocks your parth. Trapped, the horde of feral
    creatures that have invaded your home close in, and you have nowhere to run.\n
    \n<b>All investigators who haven\'t resigned are killed.</b>\n
    \n<b>If the lead investigator is killed, choose an investigator to earn the Lita Chandler card.</b></string>

    <!--Scenario Two - The Midnight Masks-->

    <string name="midnight_setup_a"><b>Scenario 2: The Midnight Masks</b>\n
        \nThe woman came to you in a panic, raving about monsters emerging from the ground in a home near Rivertown.
        \"I managed to trap them,\" she explains, \"but there are others. Other pits. Other domains.\" Only last
        week, you would have thought she was a lunatic. Recent events, however, have challenged your preconceptions
        of normality. You decide to hear her out.\n
    \nShe introduces herself as Lita Chantler and lays out a tale that strains the limits of your
    belief. \"The creatures I speak of,\" she claims, \"are called ghouls - cruel beings who plague
    the crypts, caverns, and tunnels beneath the city of Arkham&#8230;\"\n
    \n\"These creatures feed on the corpses of humans, and they are
    served by a dark cult within Arkham whose members have inexplicably come to worship the ancient
    master of the ghouls. This cult has been killing innocent people and feeding them to the ghouls,
    satiating a monstrous hunger. A dark balance was maintained. Until now. Recently,\" Lita continues,
    \"one of their lairs, where the corpses were stored, was destroyed. Since then, the ghouls have
    been more active than usual. I have tracked their movements and tried my best to stop them from
    running amok throughout the city. But I think there is something worse going on. The cult has been
    planning something darker, and more ominous, than anything I have yet observed. Indicates are
    that this plan shall come to fruition tonight, shortly after midnight. Beyond that, I cannot
    fathom what to expect.\n
    \n\"Many of the cultists,\" Lita continues, \"will seem like everyday people, despite their foul
    intentions. Whenever the cult meets, its members don masks shaped like the skulls of various
    animals to protect their identities from one another. These masks are our mark. Symbols of death
    and decay. We must unmask the cultists to expose and derail their plans. We have but a few hours.
    The more cultists we find before midnight, the better.\"</string>

        \nIn the wake of the disaster at your home, Lita Chantler, the

    <!--Scenario Three - The Devourer Below-->

    <string name="devourer_setup"><b>Scenario 3: The Devourer Below</b>\n
        \nAfter a frantic nighttime search throughout Arkham, you have tracked
    down and questioned several members of the cult. Your finds are disturbing: they claim to worship
    a being known as Umordhoth, a monstrous entity from another realm.\n
    \nYou are able to confirm much of Lita\'s story: the cult is agitated over the destruction of a
    ghoul lair. However, a surprising detail also turns up: the one who invaded the lair and set this
    night\'s events in motion was none other than Lita Chantler herself! You are not sure why this
    important detail was omitted from Lita\'s story - did she tell you only as much as was necessary
    to draw you into her conflict? But in another light, she seems to be fighting to protect the city
    of Arkham from a terrible menace.\n
    \nThe final piece of the puzzle was found written in a journal possessed by one of the cultists.
    It describes a dark ritual to be performed deep within the woods south of Arkham, this very night.
    According to the journal, the ritual\'s completion will open a gate and bring forth the cult\'s
    dark master into this world. \"If the cult is not stopped,\" Lita warns, \"there is a possibility
    that Umordhoth\'s vengeance will consume all in its path.\" Frightened but determined to stop
    the ritual, you head into the woods&#8230;</string>

    She realizes that she has failed and Umordhoth\'s vengeance will pursue her wherever she goes.
    The creature\'s tendrils spread throughout the city of Arkham, searching for her. It lurks in the
    darkness of every corner, tugging at the seams of reality. But Lita is nowhere to be found, so the
    creature dwells in the shadows to this day, searching&#8230;killing.\n
    \n<b>Arkham succumbed to Umordhoth\'s terrible vengeance.</b>\n

    but very few townspeople believe your tale. Perhaps it was all in your head, after all.\n

    <string name="devourer_resolution_two">Through force of arms and strength of will, you are
    somehow able to harm Umordhoth enough to send it reeling back to the dimension from which it
    emerged. Warmth and light return to the woods as the void-like mass is sucked in upon itself,
    vanishing in an instant. You aren\'t sure if a being such as this can be killed, but for the time
    being it seems to have retreated. As their master vanishes, the ghouls nearby climb into the open
    pit below, fleeing with terrible cries and shrieks. You have stopped an evil plot, but the fight
    has taken its toll on your body and mind. Worse, you can\'t help but feel insignificant in the
    face of the world\'s mysteries. What other terrors exist in the deep, dark corners of reality?\n
    \n<b>The investigators repelled Umordhoth.</b>\n
    \n<b>The investigators win!</b></string>
    <string name="devourer_resolution_three">In the face of this horror, you don\'t believe there is
    anything you can do to stop it. You have but one hope if you are to survive. You turn on Lita and
    throw her at the terrible monstrosity, watching in dread as its swirling void-like mass consumes
    her. She cries out in torment as the life is sucked from her body. \"Umordhoth&#8230;Umordhoth&#8230;\"
    the cultists chant. Lita Chantler vanishes without a trace. For a moment, you fear that the creature
    will turn on you, but you hear one of the cultists say, \"Umordhoth is a just god who claims only
    the guilty and the dead. Go, and you shall be spared.\" The swirling mass vanishes, and warmth
    and light return to the woods. The cultists slink away, leaving you alive. Lita\'s last moments
    are forever etched upon your memory.\n
    \n<b>The investigators sacrificed Lita Chantler to Umordhoth.</b>\n

    \nDr. Henry Armitage pours himself a glass of pinot and sits down at his desk, gesturing for you to sit
        across from him. \"I apologize for the short notice,\" he begins. His face is pale, his forehead sweaty
        and wrinkled with worry.\n
    \nArmitage - the head librarian of Miskatonic University, and a former mentor of yours - privately
        contacted you in the hopes of gaining your assistance. Eager to help, you made your way to his home in
        Southside. Upon entering, you were surprised to find his home in disarray. Books and notes litter his
        desk, and an empty bottle of wine has tipped over onto the ground by the fireplace. You\'d always known
        Armitage to be neat and well-organized.\n
    \nThe elderly man takes a moment to collect his thoughts. \"I am looking for two of my colleagues - Dr.
        Francis Morgan, professor archaeology, and Warren Rice, professor of languages. Warren was supposed to
        meet up with me over supper earlier today to discuss several important findings, but he has since gone
        missing. At first I thought nothing of it, but I have a nagging feeling something else is going on. A
        very&#8230;<b>familiar</b> feeling.\" You\'ve never seen Armitage quite this worried before. His hands
        tremble as he reaches for the glass on his desk, and he sips from it nervously. \"I tried to find
        Francis, hoping he knew where Warren was, but he too is out of touch. Francis has been spending a lot
        of time in some gambling den, or so I am told.\n
    \n\"I sent for you because I am worried Warren might be in trouble. I would appreciate it greatly if you
        could find him for me. You may also wish to ask Francis for help, if you can reach him.\"</string>

    is in trouble, but he\'s not particularly happy with his colleague\'s present choice of company. He\'s in
        the Clover Club, a notorious gambling joint somewhere downtown. Finding the club\'s exact location
        isn\'t easy - you have to grease a few palms just to learn which of the Downtown restaurants operates
        as the club\'s front. That restaurant is La Bella Luna, a somewhat upscale Italian eatery by the
        theatre. You change into your Sunday best and make your way there.\n
    \nIn front of La Bella Luna stands a man in a pinstripe suit who sizes you up as you approach. \"Enjoy

        crowd and are horrified to see the building from which you fled just minutes earlier reduced to rubble.

    <string name="house_resolution_two">\"What in the world&#8230;?\" Dr. Morgan finally breaks out of his daze

        \"It\'s all a haze,\" he explains, visibly exhausted. \"I was having the run of my life! Perhaps I had
        one too many shots. But, those creatures - I haven\'t seen anything like that since&#8230;\" He trails
        off, and you can tell that his mind is racing. His eyes widen with realization and his face pales. \"I

        their hands under their suit jackets when they see you. \"Peter,\" she says with a sigh of relief,
        \"Good, you\'re okay. I heard there was trouble?\" She turns and glares at you with deadly eyes. \"Who

    \nMr. Clover dusts off his vest, unworried. \"Naomi, my dear, these are friends of mine. They&#8230;\" he

    from within. Unsure of what to say, you give a vague statement about not remembering much. \"We\'re

        language you cannot decode, using a script you\'ve never seen in your entire life. Fortunately, it
        seems Dr. Armitage had already gone through the trouble of translating it into English. Apparently, it

        \n<b>Terror Grips New Orleans!</b>\n
    \nMinnie Klein, your contact at the Arkham Advertiser, had slipped you a draft of the article over a cup of
        coffee at Velma\'s Diner. It would have gone to print had Doyle Jeffries, the lead editor, not scoffed at
        the concept. \"I believe his exact words were, \'I ain\'t printing the ravings of some Voodoo lunatic
        and passing it off as news,\'\" she explained. From the sly grin spreading across her face, you could
        tell she smelled a story.\n
    \nThe headline was sensationalist. Three killings in nine days was enough to spook a town, sure. But you
        doubt all of New Orleans is gripped by terror, or even knows about the killings. Still, something
        piqued your interest. \"Lady Esprit,\" the Voodoo priestess from the article, claimed that a malign
        curse had taken root in the bayou.\n
    \n\"There\'s something to this, isn\'t there? I know that look,\" Minnie said. You weren\'t sure. If Lady
        Esprit was right, this \"roux-ga-roux\" wouldn\'t stop killing at three, that\'s for sure. But curses?
        Wolf-people? How could such things be real? Only one way to find out. You put on your coat and head for

    a secluded corner of the earth where he can harm no one. However, the curse lives on. He sees it in your
        eyes and grips your arm tightly. \"Don\'t let it take control,\" he warns. \"I was weak, but you - I
